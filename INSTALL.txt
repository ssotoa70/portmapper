You may need to add these python packages to operate this, but you do NOT require a virtual environment anymore.  Run this in your shell to capture these.

This technically requires Python 3.9.x as a minimum, check your version:
python3 --version
Python 3.13.7

pip3 install PyQt6 Pillow pandas requests --break-system-packages

(This sound bad, it is not, it wont break anything)

Then simply execute: ./portmapper.py
